After the victim was killed, the residence was set on fire. The autopsy found that the victim had been shot to death. The victim worked with his step-father at Rayco Roofing in Manassas, Virginia. Evidence at the scene suggests that the victim interrupted the burglary of his home and was subsequently killed. From the Unsolved Mysteries Podcast 'Deadly Intruders': It i­s a cold, rainy April afternoon in 2003 when Carlo Bertelli stops by his rural Fauquier County, VA home to pick up his 20-year-old stepson Bryan Mace. They work together at a roofing company and, even though Bryan has the day off, Carlo needs his help on a job. He tried a couple of times to reach Bryan on his cell, but there ha­s been no answer, and when he tries his key in the garage door into the house, it doesn'­t work. When Carlo finally gets into the house, through another door, he's engulfed in a wave of thick black smoke. Believing Bryan must be trapped inside, Carlo rushes in to find him, and stumbles over his body near the first door he tried to enter. Assuming Bryan has been overcome by smoke while trying to escape, Carlo pulls him out into the garage only to realize he has been shot in the head. Carlo's extensive gun collection has been stolen along with a few other household items, and the house has been ransacked. Investigators surmise that Bryan, returning from a local video store, surprised the robbers in the act, and they killed him and set the fire to destroy any evidence. Eighteen years later, nobody has been arrested for the crimes nor have any of the firearms taken from the home been recovered. Was the robbery committed by someone the family knew? Did the burglars target the home knowing Carlo kept a large collection of guns, or was it a random act of theft and violence committed by complete strangers? Bryan'­s family waits for answers that have been a long time coming.",Bryan,Mace,male,"5'11""",151,20,white,brown,brown,Sergeant Dawn,Arrington,540-422-8650,"78 West Lee St, Warrenton, VA 20186",cid@fauquiercounty.gov,POINT (-77.72308 38.59706)

Richmond police last night were investigating a shooting in the East End and the discovery of a body in South Richmond.
Authorities say the two cases appear unrelated.
Officers were summoned about 7:15 p.m. to the 1400 block of Minefee Street in the Oak Grove Bellemeade area of South Richmond and found a body behind a vacant house, police spokesman James Mercante said.
Police believe the victim was shot. They described him as a man about 30 to 40 years old.
Two men at the scene who identified themselves as Phabien Bennett and Marquise Jeffries said that two children around age 8 found the body.
Bennett said the frightened children approached him and Jeffries and led them to the body.
Police were summoned to the second shooting shortly after 8 p.m. A male was shot in the abdomen in the 2300 block of Selden Street in the Fairfield Court public housing complex, police said.
The male victim was taken to VCU Medical Center with injuries that initially did not appear lifethreatening. ",Napoleon,Hargrove Jr.,male,"5' 10""",180,42,black,blue,black,D/Sgt. George,Wade,(804) 646-6741,200 W. Grace Street ,GEORGE.WADE@RVA.GOV,POINT (-77.43574896705059 37.50245214321675)

They took a vacation trip to Virginia Beach, Virginia on August 20, the day after Monaco's eighteenth birthday, and registered at the Aloha Motel on 15th Street.

Monaco and her sister went to the Country Comfort bar on Pacific Avenue on the night of August 22. A man there kept urging Monaco to go out with him, and told her he had a yacht, but she was uninterested. Monaco was last seen at 1:00 a.m. August 23, when she left her sister and began walking to a bar called Peabody's, where she had a prearranged a date with a bartender.

The bar was six blocks away. Witnesses saw Monaco get into a car on Pacific Avenue; the vehicle reportedly contained four or five men. She never arrived for her date and has never been heard from again. Her sister tried to report her as a missing person later that day, but the police refused to take a report for 48 hours.

Eight months after Monaco's disappearance, her family advertised a $10,000 reward for her recovery, dead or alive. In response to the ad, a man came forward claiming he had witnessed Monaco's rape and murder the night of her disappearance. He told investigators that Monaco's killers had abducted her as she walked along Pacific Avenue, put her in a sedan, drove her to a lakeside cottage near Oceana, Virginia, killed her and dumped her body in a lake.

Authorities dragged the lake and found a cinder block with a rope tied to it, but they didn't find Monaco's remains. The informant reportedly passed a polygraph exam, but he ceased cooperating after authorities refused to offer him immunity from prosecution in exchange for his testimony.

Other witnesses and suspects have been interviewed over the years. James L. ""Jimbo"" Moore Jr. spoke to the police in 2001 and reportedly gave them information he could only have known if he was with Monaco on the night of her disappearance. He agreed to take a polygraph to verify the authenticity of his story, but only hours after he made his statement, before he could take the test, took his own life outside his apartment.",Barbara Jean,Monaco,female,"5'4""",110,18,white,brown,brown,Det.

At the truck stop, John Doe told John he had been stuck at the truck stop for two days without food. John Doe stated he was trying to get to an uncertain location to go camping. John made an offer to pay John Doe for unloading his truck. They arrived in New Jersey on the 18th of May, and he paid John Doe $50 for unloading help. John Doe bought food and a small folding knife with this money. An argument ensued over money, with John Doe demanding $100 and several of Swartz's personal items in the truck. John Doe threatened to turn in John for having an unauthorized rider and put John's name and truck company in his pocket at some point. The next day they got another load and started back toward Arkansas. While at a truck stop in Raphine, Virginia, Swartz said that Jon Doe pulled out his knife and made threats of harm if he did not get more money or Swartz's personal items. Around 4.00 a.m., several miles down Interstate 81, Swartz pulled over to the shoulder and told John Doe that he had to relieve himself. John Doe got out and, the following day was shot and killed. The next morning Swartz discarded John Doe's possessions and continued to Arkansas. Swartz died in prison. John Doe is still unidentified, and his remains are being held by the Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.
